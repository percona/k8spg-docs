1. During the installation, the Operator has generated several
    [secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/),
    including the one with password for default PostgreSQL user. This default
    user has the login name same as the the cluster.

    Use `kubectl get secrets` command to see the list of Secrets objects. The
    Secrets object you are interested in is named as
    `<cluster_name>-pguser-<cluster_name>`, so the default variant will be
    `cluster1-pguser-cluster1`. You can use the following command to get the
    password of this user:
    
    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get secret <cluster_name>-<user_name>-<cluster_name> --template='{{"{{"}}.data.password | base64decode{{"}}"}}{{"{{"}}"\n"{{"}}"}}'
    ```

2. Run a container with `psql` tool and connect its console output to your
    terminal. The following command will do this, naming the new Pod
    `pg-client`:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" data-prompt-second="[postgres@pg-client /]$"}
    $ kubectl run -i --rm --tty pg-client --image=perconalab/percona-distribution-postgresql:{{ postgresrecommended }} --restart=Never -- bash -il
    [postgres@pg-client /]$ PGPASSWORD='pguser_password' psql -h cluster1-pgbouncer.postgres-operator.svc -p 5432 -U cluster1 cluster1
    ```

    Executing it may require some time to deploy the correspondent Pod.

    This command will connect you as a `cluster1` user to a `cluster1` database
    via the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" data-prompt-second="pgdb=>"}
    psql ({{ postgresrecommended }})
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.
    pgdb=>
    ```

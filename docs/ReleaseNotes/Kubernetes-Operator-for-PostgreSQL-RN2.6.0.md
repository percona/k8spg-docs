## Deprecation, Change, Rename and Removal

With the Operator versions prior to 2.6.0, [autogenerated TLS certificates](../TLS.md#allow-the-operator-to-generate-certificates-automatically) for all database clusters were based on the same generated root CA. Starting from 2.5.0, the Operator creates root CA on a per-cluster basis.


## Supported platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with PostgreSQL versions 13.18, 14.15, 15.10, 16.6, and 17.2. Other options may also work but have not been tested. The Operator 2.6.0 provides connection pooling based on pgBouncer 1.23.1 and high-availability implementation based on Patroni 4.0.3.

Percona Operators are designed for compatibility with all [CNCF-certified :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) Kubernetes distributions. Our release process includes targeted testing and validation on major cloud provider platforms and OpenShift, as detailed below for Operator version 2.6.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.29 - 1.31
* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.29 - 1.32
* [OpenShift :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.14.46 - 4.17.15
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) 1.29 - 1.31
* [Minikube :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) 1.35.0 with Kubernetes 1.32.0

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.

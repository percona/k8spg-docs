    [Installing Percona Operator for PostgreSQL](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines) 


The Percona Operator built with best practices of configuration and setup of
[Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL on Kubernetes :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/index.html).

Percona Operator for PostgreSQL helps create and manage highly available, enterprise-ready PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. It is 100% open source, free from vendor lock-in, usage restrictions and expensive contracts, and includes enterprise-ready features: backup/restore, high availability, replication, logging, and more.

The benefits of using Percona Operator for PostgreSQL include saving time on database operations via automation of Day-1 and Day-2 operations and deployment of consistent and vetted environment on Kubernetes.

!!! note

    Version 2.1.0 of the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL is a **tech preview release** and it is **not recommended for production environments.**
    As of today, we recommend using [Percona Operator for PostgreSQL 1.x](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/1.0/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale PostgreSQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release Highlights

* PostgreSQL 15 is now officially supported by the Operator with the [new exciting features :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.percona.com/blog/postgresql-15-new-features-to-be-excited-about/) it brings to developers

* UX improvements related to Custom Resource have been added in this release, including the handy `pg`, `pg-backup`, and `pg-restore` short names useful to quickly query the cluster state with the `kubectl get` command and additional information in the status fields, which now show `name`, `endpoint`, `status`, and `age`

## New Features

* {{ k8spgjira(328) }}: The new `delete-pvc` finalizer allows to either delete or preserve Persistent Volumes at Custom Resource deletion

* {{ k8spgjira(330) }}: The new `delete-ssl` finalizer can now be used to automatically delete objects created for SSL (Secret, certificate, and issuer) in case of cluster deletion

* {{ k8spgjira(331) }}: Starting from now, the Operator adds short names to its Custom Resources: `pg`, `pg-backup`, and `pg-restore`

* {{ k8spgjira(282) }}: PostgreSQL 15 is now officially supported by the Operator

## Improvements

* {{ k8spgjira(262) }}: The Operator now does not attempt to start Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) client if the corresponding secret does not contain the `pmmserver` or `pmmserverkey` key

* {{ k8spgjira(285) }}: To improve the Operator we capture anonymous telemetry and usage data. In this release we [add more data points](../telemetry.md) to it

* {{ k8spgjira(295) }}: Additional information was added to the status of the Operator Custom Resource, which now shows `name`, `endpoint`, `status`, and `age` fields

* {{ k8spgjira(304) }}: The Operator stops using trust authentication method in `pg_hba.conf` for better security

* {{ k8spgjira(325) }}: Custom Resource options previously named `paused` and `shutdown` were renamed to `unmanaged` and `pause` for better alignment with other Percona Operators

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spgjira(272) }}: Fix a bug due to which PMM agent related to the Pod wasn't deleted from the PMM Server inventory on Pod termination

* {{ k8spgjira(279) }}: Fix a bug which made the Operator to crash after creating a backup if there was no `backups.pgbackrest.manual` section in the Custom Resource

* {{ k8spgjira(298) }}: Fix a bug due to which the `shutdown` Custom Resource option didn't work making it impossible to pause the cluster

* {{ k8spgjira(334) }}: Fix a bug which made it possible for the monitoring user to have special characters in the autogenerated password, making it incompatible with the PMM Client

## Supported platforms

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
2.1.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.23 - 1.25

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.23 - 1.25

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.

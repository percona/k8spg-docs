# Providing Backups

The Operator allows doing backups in two ways.
*Scheduled backups* are configured in the
[deploy/cr.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml)
file to be executed automatically in proper time. *On-demand backups*
can be done manually at any moment.

The Operator uses the open source [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) backup
and restore utility. A special *pgBackRest repository* is created by the
Operator along with creating a new PostgreSQL cluster to facilitate the usage of
the pgBackRest features in it.

The Operator can store PostgreSQL backups on Amazon S3, [any S3-compatible
storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3#S3_API_and_competing_services)
and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) outside the
Kubernetes cluster. Storing backups on [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
attached to the pgBackRest Pod is also possible. At PostgreSQL cluster creation
time, you can specify a specific Storage Class for the pgBackRest repository.
Additionally, you can also specify the type of the pgBackRest repository that
can be used for backups:


* `local`: Uses the storage that is provided by the Kubernetes cluster’s 
Storage Class that you select (for historical reasons this repository type can
be alternatively named `posix`),
* `s3`: Use Amazon S3 or an object storage system that uses the S3 protocol,
* `local,s3`: Use both the storage that is provided by the Kubernetes
cluster’s Storage Class that you select AND Amazon S3 (or equivalent object
storage system that uses the S3 protocol).
* `gcs`: Use Google Cloud Storage,
* `local,gcs`: Use both the storage that is provided by the Kubernetes
cluster’s Storage Class that you select AND Google Cloud Storage.

The pgBackRest repository consists of the following Kubernetes objects:

* A Deployment,
* A Secret that contains information that is specific to the PostgreSQL cluster
that it is deployed with (e.g. SSH keys, AWS S3 keys, etc.),
* A Pod with a number of supporting scripts,
* A Service.

The PostgreSQL primary is automatically configured to use the
`pgbackrest archive-push` and push the write-ahead log (WAL) archives to the
correct repository.

The PostgreSQL Operator supports three types of pgBackRest backups:

* Full (`full`): A full backup of all the contents of the PostgreSQL cluster,
* Differential (`diff`): A backup of only the files that have changed since
the last full backup,
* Incremental (`incr`): A backup of only the files that have changed since the
last full or differential backup. Incremental backup is the default choice.

The Operator also supports setting pgBackRest retention policies for backups.
Backup retention can be controlled by the following pgBackRest options:

* `--repo1-retention-full` the number of full backups to retain,
* `--repo1-retention-diff` the number of differential backups to retain,
* `--repo1-retention-archive` how many sets of write-ahead log archives to
retain alongside the full and differential backups that are retained.

You can set both backups type and retention policy when Making on-demand backup.

Also you should first configure the backup storage in the `deploy/cr.yaml`
configuration file to have backups enabled.

## Configuring the S3-compatible backup storage

In order to use S3-compatible storage for backups you need to provide some
S3-related information, such as proper S3 bucket name, endpoint, etc. This
information can be passed to pgBackRest via the following `deploy/cr.yaml`
options in the `backup.storages` subsection:

* `bucket` specifies the AWS S3 bucket that should be utilized,
for example `my-postgresql-backups-example`,
* `endpointUrl` specifies the S3 endpoint that should be utilized,
for example `s3.amazonaws.com`,
* `region` specifies the AWS S3 region that should be utilized,
for example `us-east-1`,
* `uriStyle` specifies whether `host` or `path` style URIs
should be utilized,
* `verifyTLS` should be set to `true` to enable TLS verification
or set to `false` to disable it,
* `type` should be set to `s3`.

You also need to supply pgBackRest with base64-encoded AWS S3 key and AWS S3 key
secret stored along with other sensitive information in [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/),
e.g. encoding needed data with the following command:

=== "in Linux"

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ echo -n 'plain-text-string' | base64 --wrap=0
    ```

=== "in macOS"

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ echo -n 'plain-text-string' | base64
    ```

Edit the `deploy/backup/cluster1-backrest-repo-config-secret.yaml`
configuration file: set there proper cluster name, AWS S3 key, and key secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-backrest-repo-config
type: Opaque
data:
  aws-s3-key: <base64-encoded-AWS-S3-key>
  aws-s3-key-secret: <base64-encoded-AWS-S3-key-secret>
```

When done, create the secret as follows:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/backup/cluster1-backrest-repo-config-secret.yaml
```

Finally, create or update the cluster:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
```

## Use Google Cloud Storage for backups

You can configure [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) as
an object store for backups similarly to S3 storage.

In order to use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for backups you need to provide some
GCS-related information, such as a proper GCS bucket name. This
information can be passed to `pgBackRest` via the following options in the
`backup.storages` subsection of the `deploy/cr.yaml` configuration file:

* `bucket` should contain the proper bucket name,
* `type` should be set to `gcs`.

The Operator will also need your service account key to access storage.

1. Create your service account key following the [official Google Cloud instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
2. Export this key from your Google Cloud account.

    You can find your key in the Google Cloud console (select *IAM & Admin*
    → *Service Accounts* in the left menu panel, then click your account and
    open the *KEYS* tab):

    ![image](assets/images/gcs-service-account.svg)

    Click the *ADD KEY* button, chose *Create new key* and chose *JSON* as a key
    type. These actions will result in downloading a file in JSON format with
    your new private key and related information.

3. Now you should use a base64-encoded version of this file and to create the [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). You can encode
    the file with the `base64 <filename>` command. When done, create the
    following yaml file with your cluster name and base64-encoded file contents:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: <cluster-name>-backrest-repo-config
    type: Opaque
    data:
      gcs-key: <base64-encoded-json-file-contents>
    ```

    When done, create the secret as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f ./my-gcs-account-secret.yaml
    ```

4. Finally, create or update the cluster:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
    ```

## Scheduling backups

Backups schedule is defined in the `backup` section of the
[deploy/cr.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml)
file. This section contains following subsections:


* `storages` subsection contains data needed to access the S3-compatible cloud
to store backups.
* `schedule` subsection allows to actually schedule backups (the schedule is
specified in crontab format).

Here is an example of [deploy/cr.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml) which uses Amazon S3 storage for backups:

```yaml
...
backup:
  ...
  schedule:
   - name: "sat-night-backup"
     schedule: "0 0 * * 6"
     keep: 3
     type: full
     storage: s3
  ...
```

The schedule is specified in crontab format as explained in
[Custom Resource options](operator.md#backup-schedule-schedule).

## Making on-demand backup

To make an on-demand backup, the user should use a backup configuration file.
The example of the backup configuration file is [deploy/backup/backup.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/backup/backup.yaml).

The following keys are most important in the parameters section of this file:


* `parameters.backrest-opts` is the string with command line options which
will be passed to pgBackRest, for example
`--type=full --repo1-retention-full=5`,
* `parameters.pg-cluster` is the name of the PostgreSQL cluster to back up,
for example `cluster1`.

When the backup options are configured, execute the actual backup command:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/backup/backup.yaml
```

## List existing backups

To get list of all existing backups in the pgBackrest repo, use the following
command:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl exec <name-of-backrest-shared-repo-pod>  -it -- pgbackrest info
```

You can find out the appropriate Pod name using the \`\` kubectl get pods\`\`
command, as usual. Here is an example of the backups list:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl exec cluster1-backrest-shared-repo-5ffc465b85-gvhlh -it -- pgbackrest info
stanza: db
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (14): 000000010000000000000001/000000010000000000000003

        full backup: 20220614-104859F
            timestamp start/stop: 2022-06-14 10:48:59 / 2022-06-14 10:49:13
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000002 / 000000010000000000000002
            database size: 33.5MB, database backup size: 33.5MB
            repo1: backup set size: 4.3MB, backup size: 4.3MB
```

In this example there is only one backup named `20220614-104859F`.

## Restore the cluster from a previously saved backup

The Operator supports the ability to perform a full restore on a PostgreSQL
cluster as well as a point-in-time-recovery. There are two types of ways to
restore a cluster:

* restore to a new cluster using the [pgDataSource.restoreFrom](operator.md#pgdatasource-restorefrom)
option (and possibly, [pgDataSource.restoreOpts](operator.md#pgdatasource-restoreopts)
for custom pgBackRest options),
* restore in-place, to an existing cluster (note that this is destructive).

Restoring to a new PostgreSQL cluster allows you to take a backup and create a
new PostgreSQL cluster that can run alongside an existing one. There are several
scenarios where using this technique is helpful:

* Creating a copy of a PostgreSQL cluster that can be used for other purposes.
Another way of putting this is *creating a clone*.
* Restore to a point-in-time and inspect the state of the data without affecting
the current cluster.

To restore the previously saved backup the user should use a *backup restore*
configuration file. The example of the backup configuration file is
[deploy/backup/restore.yaml](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/backup/restore.yaml):

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
apiVersion: pg.percona.com/v1
kind: Pgtask
metadata:
  labels:
    pg-cluster: cluster1
    pgouser: admin
  name: cluster1-backrest-restore
  namespace: pgo
spec:
  name: cluster1-backrest-restore
  namespace: pgo
  parameters:
    backrest-restore-from-cluster: cluster1
    backrest-restore-opts: --type=time --target="2021-04-16 15:13:32+00"
    backrest-storage-type: local
  tasktype: restore
```

The following keys are the most important in the parameters section of this file:

* `parameters.backrest-restore-cluster` specifies the name of a
PostgreSQL cluster which will be restored (this option had name
`parameters.backrest-restore-from-cluster` before the Operator 1.2.0).
It includes stopping the database and recreating a new primary with the
restored data (for example, `cluster1`),
* `parameters.backrest-restore-opts` passes through additional options for
pgBackRest,
* `parameters.backrest-storage-type` the type of the pgBackRest repository,
(for example, `local`).

The actual restoration process can be started as follows:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/backup/restore.yaml
```

To create a new PostgreSQL cluster from either the active  one, or a former cluster
whose pgBackRest repository still exists,  use the [pgDataSource.restoreFrom](operator.md#pgdatasource-restorefrom)
option.

The following example will create a new cluster named `cluster2` from an
existing one named\`\`cluster1\`\`.

1. First, create the `cluster2-config-secrets.yaml` configuration file with
the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      password: <base64-encoded-password-for-pguser>
      username: <base64-encoded-pguser-user-name>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        pg-cluster: cluster2
        vendor: crunchydata
      name: cluster2-pguser-secret
    type: Opaque
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      password: <base64-encoded-password-for-primaryuser>
      username: <base64-encoded-primaryuser-user-name>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        pg-cluster: cluster2
        vendor: crunchydata
      name: cluster2-primaryuser-secret
    type: Opaque
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      password: <base64-encoded-password-for-postgres-user>
      username: <base64-encoded-pguser-postgres-name>
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        pg-cluster: cluster2
        vendor: crunchydata
      name: cluster2-postgres-secret
    type: Opaque
    ```

2. When done, create the secrets as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f ./cluster2-config-secrets.yaml
    ```

3. Edit the `deploy/cr.yaml` configuration file:

    * set a new cluster name (`cluster2`),
    * set the option [pgDataSource.restoreFrom](operator.md#pgdatasource-restorefrom) to `cluster1`.

4. Create the cluster as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
    ```

## Restore the cluster with point-in-time recovery

Point-in-time recovery functionality allows users to revert the database back to
a state before an unwanted change had occurred.

You can set up a point-in-time recovery using the normal restore command of
pgBackRest with few additional options specified in the
`parameters.backrest-restore-opts` key in the [backup restore configuration file](https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator/blob/main/deploy/backup/restore.yaml):

```yaml
...
spec:
  name: cluster1-backrest-restore
  namespace: pgo
  parameters:
    backrest-restore-from-cluster: cluster1
    backrest-restore-opts: --type=time --target="2021-04-16 15:13:32+00"
```

* set `--type` option to `time`,
* set `--target` to a specific time you would like to restore to. You can use
the typical string formatted as `<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:DD>`, optionally followed
by a timezone offset: `"2021-04-16 15:13:32+00"` (`+00` in the above
example means just UTC),
* optional `--set` argument allows you to choose the backup which will be the
starting point for point-in-time recovery (look through the available backups
to find out the proper backup name). This option must be specified if the target is
one or more backups away from the current moment.

After setting these options in the *backup restore* configuration file,
follow the standard restore instructions.

!!! note

    Make sure you have a backup that is older than your desired point in time.
    You obviously can’t restore from a time where you do not have a backup.
    All relevant write-ahead log files must be successfully pushed before you
    make the restore.

## Delete a previously saved backup

The maximum amount of stored backups is controlled by the
[backup.schedule.keep](operator.md#backup-schedule-keep) option (only successful
backups are counted). Older backups are automatically deleted, so that amount of
stored backups do not exceed this number.

If you want to delete some backup manually, you need to delete both the
`pgtask` object and the corresponding job itself. Deletion of the backup
object can be done using the same YAML file which was used for the on-demand
backup:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/backup/backup.yaml
```

Deletion of the job which corresponds to the backup can be done using
`kubectl delete jobs` command with the backup name:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl delete jobs cluster1-backrest-full-backup
```

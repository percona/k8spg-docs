# Percona Operator for PostgreSQL single-namespace and multi-namespace deployment

There are two design patterns that you can choose from when deploying Percona Operator for PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL clusters in Kubernetes:

* Namespace-scope - one Operator per Kubernetes namespace,

* Cluster-wide - one Operator can manage clusters in multiple namespaces.

This how-to explains how to configure Percona Operator for PostgreSQL for each scenario.

## Namespace-scope

By default, Percona Operator for PostgreSQL functions in a specific Kubernetes namespace. You can
create one during the installation (like it is shown in the
[installation instructions](kubernetes.md)) or just use the default namespace. This approach allows several Operators to co-exist in one Kubernetes-based environment, being separated in different namespaces:

Normally this is a recommended approach, as isolation minimizes impact in case of various failure scenarios. This is the default configuration of our Operator.

Let’s say you will use a Kubernetes Namespace called `percona-db-1`.

1. Clone `percona-postgresql-operator` repository:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ git clone -b v{{ release }} https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator
    $ cd percona-postgresql-operator
    ```

2. Create your `percona-db-1` Namespace (if it doesn't yet exist) as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace percona-db-1
    ```

3. Deploy the Operator [using :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
    the following command:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply --server-side -f deploy/bundle.yaml -n percona-db-1
    ```

4. Once Operator is up and running, deploy the database cluster itself:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n percona-db-1
    ```

You can deploy multiple clusters in this namespace.

### Add more namespaces

What if there is a need to deploy clusters in another namespace? The solution for namespace-scope deployment is to have more than one Operator. We will use the `percona-db-2` namespace as an example.

1. Create your `percona-db-2` namespace (if it doesn't yet exist) as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace percona-db-2
    ```

2. Deploy the Operator:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply --server-side -f deploy/bundle.yaml -n percona-db-2
    ```

3. Once Operator is up and running deploy the database cluster itself:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n percona-db-2
    ```

    !!! note

        Cluster names may be the same in different namespaces.

## Install the Operator cluster-wide

Sometimes it is more convenient to have one Operator watching for
Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL custom resources in several namespaces.

We recommend running Percona Operator for PostgreSQL in a traditional way,
limited to a specific namespace, to limit the blast radius. But it is possible
to run it in so-called *cluster-wide* mode, one Operator watching several
namespaces, if needed:

![image](assets/images/cluster-wide-2.svg)

To use the Operator in such cluster-wide mode, you should install it with a
different set of configuration YAML files, which are available in the deploy
folder and have filenames with a special `cw-` prefix: e.g.
`deploy/cw-bundle.yaml`.

While using this cluster-wide versions of configuration files, you should set
the following information there:

* `subjects.namespace` option should contain the namespace which will host
    the Operator,
* `WATCH_NAMESPACE` key-value pair in the `env` section should have
    `value` equal to a  comma-separated list of the namespaces to be watched by
    the Operator, *and* the namespace in which the Operator resides. If this key
    is set to a blank string, the Operator will watch
    **only the namespace it runs in**, which would be the same as
    [single-namespace deployment](cluster-wide.md#namespace-scope).

!!! note

    Installing the Operator cluster-wide on OpenShift via the the Operator
    Lifecycle Manager (OLM) requires
    [making different selections in the OLM web-based UI](openshift.md#install-the-operator-via-the-operator-lifecycle-manager-olm)
    instead of patching YAML files.

The following simple example shows how to install Operator cluster-wide on
Kubernetes.

1. Clone `percona-postgresql-operator` repository:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ git clone -b v{{ release }} https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator
    $ cd percona-postgresql-operator
    ```

2. Let’s say you will use `pg-operator` namespace for the Operator, and `percona-db-1`
    namespace for the cluster. Create these namespaces, if needed:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace pg-operator
    $ kubectl create namespace percona-db-1
    ```

3. Edit the ``deploy/cw-bundle.yaml`` configuration file to make sure it
    contains proper namespace name for the Operator:

    ```yaml
    ...
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: percona-postgresql-operator
      namespace: pg-operator
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
          value: "pg-operator,percona-db-1"
    ...
    ```

4. Apply the `deploy/cw-bundle.yaml` file with the following command:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply --server-side -f deploy/cw-bundle.yaml -n pg-operator
    ```

    Right now the operator deployed in cluster-wide mode will monitor all
    namespaces in the cluster, either already existing or newly created ones.

5. Deploy the cluster in the namespace of your choice:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n percona-db-1
    ```

## Verifying the cluster operation

When creation process is over, you can try to connect to the cluster.

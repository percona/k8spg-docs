# The Operator installation options

When installing The Operator, you can customize additional configuration options. These options are specified in `deploy/operator.yaml` file and already have reasonable defaults, so most users have no need modifying them.

## Storage Settings 

The store configuration options defined in this section can be used to specify the storage configurations that are used by the PostgreSQL Operator.

### Storage Configuration Options

Kubernetes and OpenShift offer support for a wide variety of different storage types and we provide suggested configurations for different environments. These storage types can be modified or removed as needed, while additional storage configurations can also be added to meet the specific storage requirements for your PostgreSQL clusters.
The following storage variables are utilized to add or modify operator storage configurations in the with the installer:

| Name                           | Required | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|:------------|
| storage<ID>_name               | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to specify a name for the storage configuration |
| storage<ID>_access_mode        | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to configure the access mode of the volumes created when using this storage definition |
| storage<ID>_size               | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to configure the size of the volumes created when using this storage definition |
| storage<ID>_class              | Required when using the dynamic storage type | Set to configure the storage class name used when creating dynamic volumes |
| storage<ID>_supplemental_groups | Required when using NFS storage | Set to configure any supplemental groups that should be added to security contexts on newly created clusters |
| storage<ID>_type               | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to either create or dynamic to configure the operator to create persistent volumes or have them created dynamically by a storage class |

The ID portion of storage prefix for each variable name above should be an integer that is used to group the various storage variables into a single storage configuration.

Example Storage Configuration:

```yaml
storage3_name: 'nfsstorage'
storage3_access_mode: 'ReadWriteMany'
storage3_size: '1G'
storage3_type: 'create'
storage3_supplemental_groups: 65534
```

As this example storage configuration shows, integer 3 is used as the ID for each of the storage variables, which together form a single storage configuration called nfsstorage. This approach allows different storage configurations to be created by defining the proper storage variables with a unique ID for each required storage configuration.

### PostgreSQL Cluster Storage Defaults

You can specify the default storage to use for PostgreSQL, pgBackRest, and other elements that require storage that can outlast the lifetime of a Pod. While the PostgreSQL Operator defaults to using default to work with the default storage class available in your environment.

| Name             | Default | Required | Description |
|:-----------------|:--------|:--------:|:------------|
| backrest_storage | default | :heavy_check_mark: | Set the value of the storage configuration to use for the pgBackRest repository |
| backup_storage   | default | :heavy_check_mark: | required, the value of the storage configuration to use for backups generated by pg_dump |
| primary_storage  | default | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL primaries on all newly created clusters |
| replica_storage  | default | :heavy_check_mark: | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL replicas on all newly created clusters |
| pgadmin_storage  | default |                    | |
| wal_storage      | `""`    |          | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used for PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log |

Example Defaults:

```yaml
backrest_storage: default
backup_storage: default
primary_storage: default
replica_storage: default
```

With the configuration shown above, the default storage class available in the deployment environment is used.

### Considerations for Multi-Zone Cloud Environments

When using the Operator in a Kubernetes cluster consisting of nodes that span multiple zones, special consideration must be taken to ensure all pods and the volumes they require are scheduled and provisioned within the same zone. Specifically, being that a pod is unable mount a volume that is located in another zone, any volumes that are dynamically provisioned must be provisioned in a topology-aware manner according to the specific scheduling requirements for the pod. For instance, this means ensuring that the volume containing the database files for the primary database in a new PostgreSQL cluster is provisioned in the same zone as the node containing the PostgreSQL primary pod that will be using it.

### Pod Anti-affinity Settings

This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters. Pod Anti-Affinity is set to determine where the PostgreSQL Pods are deployed relative to each other There are three levels:

* `required`: Pods must be scheduled to different Nodes. If a Pod cannot be scheduled to a different Node from the other Pods in the anti-affinity group, then it will not be scheduled. 
* `preferred` (default): Pods should be scheduled to different Nodes. There is a chance that two Pods in the same anti-affinity group could be scheduled to the same node 
* `disabled`: Pods do not have any anti-affinity rules.

The `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY` label sets the Pod anti-affinity for all of the Pods that are managed by the Operator in a PostgreSQL cluster. In addition to the PostgreSQL Pods, this also includes the pgBackRest repository and any pgBouncer pods. By default, the pgBackRest and pgBouncer pods inherit the value of `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY`, but one can override the default by setting the `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBACKREST` and `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBOUNCER` variables for pgBackRest and pgBouncer respectively.

| Name                         | Default     | Required | Description |
|:-----------------------------|:------------|:--------:|:------------|
| pod_anti_affinity            | `preferred` |          | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters |
| pod_anti_affinity_pgbackrest | `""`        |          | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBackRest pods |
| pod_anti_affinity_pgbouncer  | `""`        |          | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBouncer pods |
